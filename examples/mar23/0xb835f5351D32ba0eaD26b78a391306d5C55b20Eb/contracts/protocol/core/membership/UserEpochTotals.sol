/// dev Epoch Awareness
/// The Membership system relies on an epoch structure to incentivize economic behavior. Deposits
/// are tracked by epoch and only count toward yield enhancements if they have been present for
/// an entire epoch. This means positions have a specific lifetime:
/// 1. Deposit Epoch - Positions are in the membership system but do not count for rewards as they
///      were not in since the beginning of the epoch. Deposits are externally triggered.
/// 2. Eligible Epoch - Positions are in the membership system and count for rewards as they have been
///      present the entire epoch.
/// 3. Withdrawal Epoch - Positions are no longer in the membership system and forfeit their rewards
///      for the withdrawal epoch. Rewards are forfeited as the position was not present for the
///      entire epoch when withdrawn. Withdrawals are externally triggered.
///
/// All of these deposits' value is summed together to calculate the yield enhancement. A naive
/// approach is, for every summation query, iterate over all deposits and check if they were deposited
/// in the current epoch (so case (1)) or in a previous epoch (so case (2)). This has a high gas
/// cost, so we use another approach: UserEpochTotal.
///
/// UserEpochTotal is the total of the user's deposits as of its lastEpochUpdate- the last epoch that
/// the total was updated in. For that epoch, it tracks:
/// 1. Eligible Amount - The sum of deposits that are in their Eligible Epoch for the current epoch
/// 2. Total Amount - The sum of deposits that will be in their Eligible Epoch for the next epoch
///
/// It is not necessary to track previous epochs as deposits in those will already be eligible, or they
/// will have been withdrawn and already affected the eligible amount.
///
/// It is also unnecessary to track future epochs beyond the next one. Any deposit in the current epoch
/// will become eligible in the next epoch. It is not possible to have a deposit (or withdrawal) take
/// effect any further in the future.
