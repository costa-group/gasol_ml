 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
