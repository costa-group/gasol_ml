/// title The Taxable Contract
/// author People's Treasury
/// notice Creates an optional tax, flexible within a hardcoded range of 0.25% to 15%. Defaults to 10%.
/// dev This contract emits events, stores tax vars, and performs checks. 

/*
NOTES:
 • Taxes stored as uint256 in points, which are 2 decimals of percentages and 4 decimals of a factor. (10000 points = 100.00% = 1.0000x)
 • To use this contract for your own ERC20 token, perform the following tasks:
   - In addition to this and the ERC20 contract, import ReentrancyGuard.sol and AccessControl for security reasons:
        import "./Taxable.sol"
        import "openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
        import "openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
        import "openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
   - Call the contracts. Example:
        contract __YOURTOKEN__ is ReentrancyGuard, ERC20, AccessControl, Taxable {}
   - Add the PRESIDENT_ROLE, GOVERNOR_ROLE, and EXCLUDED_ROLE vars inside the contract as public constants:
        bytes32 public constant GOVERNOR_ROLE = keccak256("GOVERNOR_ROLE");
        bytes32 public constant PRESIDENT_ROLE = keccak256("PRESIDENT_ROLE");
        bytes32 public constant EXCLUDED_ROLE = keccak256("EXCLUDED_ROLE"); 
   - In addition to the standard admin role, add the PRESIDENT_ROLE, GOVERNOR_ROLE, and EXCLUDED_ROLE roles to the standard ERC20 constructor:
        constructor() ERC20("__YOURTOKEN__", "__YOURTOKENSYMBOL__") {
            _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _grantRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _grantRole(PRESIDENT_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _grantRole(EXCLUDED_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _mint(msg.sender, __INITIALMINT__ * 10 ** decimals());
        }
   - Add the public functions for the GOVERNOR_ROLE to enable, disable, an update the tax:
        function enableTax() public onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE) { _taxon(); }
        function disableTax() public onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE) { _taxoff(); }
        function updateTax(uint newtax) public onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE) { _updatetax(newtax); }
   - Add the public function for the PRESIDENT_ROLE to update the tax destination address:
        function updateTaxDestination(address newdestination) public onlyRole(PRESIDENT_ROLE) { _updatetaxdestination(newdestination); }
   - Override the _transfer() function to perform the necessary tax functions:
        function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) // Overrides the _transfer() function to use an optional transfer tax.
            internal
            virtual
            override(ERC20) // Specifies only the ERC20 contract for the override.
            nonReentrant // Prevents re-entrancy attacks.
            {
                if(hasRole(EXCLUDED_ROLE, from) || hasRole(EXCLUDED_ROLE, to) || !taxed()) { // If to/from a tax excluded address or if tax is off...
                    super._transfer(from, to, amount); // Transfers 100% of amount to recipient.
                } else { // If not to/from a tax excluded address & tax is on...
                    require(balanceOf(from) >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"); // Makes sure sender has the required token amount for the total.
                    // If the above requirement is not met, then it is possible that the sender could pay the tax but not the recipient, which is bad...
                    super._transfer(from, taxdestination(), amount*thetax()/10000); // Transfers tax to the tax destination address.
                    super._transfer(from, to, amount*(10000-thetax())/10000); // Transfers the remainder to the recipient.
                }
            }
 • The EXCLUDED_ROLE is for any wallet or contract that would be contradicted to tax to/from such as the deployer, the treasury, or a vesting contract.
 • The GOVERNOR_ROLE can be a governance controlled contract to enable/disable and change the tax amount based on proposal results.
 • The PRESIDENT_ROLE is not the GOVERNOR_ROLE because the address to change the destination address and tax amount is a target for an exploit.
 • It is recommended that the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE renounce either/both the PRESIDENT_ROLE and/or the GOVERNOR_ROLE and assign these to unconnected accounts.
 • Once all roles are set up, it is recommended that the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE add a Multisig admin and renounce the admin role as well as any unnecessary roles.
 • To send the tax to multiple end recipients, consider setting the tax destination address to a splitter contract like PaymentSplitter.sol or 0xSplits.
