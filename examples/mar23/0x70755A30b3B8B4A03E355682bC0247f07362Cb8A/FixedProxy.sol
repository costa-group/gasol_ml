  The FixedProxy contract implements delegation of calls to other contracts (`implementations`), with
  proper forwarding of return values and revert reasons.

  The FixedProxy contract is initialized with a fixed implementation that is set in deployment.
  The intention is that this contract is a cheap to deploy facade of a much heavier contract.

  Upon deployment, an optional bytes array is passed, and is delegated to the implementation address,
  as an initializer.
