 * The Guest List (TGL) is a new platform that aims to overhaul the “shitcoin” space by linking top-quality 
 * start-up projects with higher quality investors. 
 *
 * Our custom-built blockchain technology tracks users’ on-chain behaviour and produces a scoring system 
 * that - if high enough - gives said users the option to buy into the private sales of the biggest 
 * new crypto launches available.  
 *
 * The higher your score, the more access you get to the best private sales – the lower your score, 
 * SORRY you’re not getting on “The Guest List.”  
 *
 * Connecting the best new projects to solid “diamond hand” investors.
 * A match made in crypto heaven.
