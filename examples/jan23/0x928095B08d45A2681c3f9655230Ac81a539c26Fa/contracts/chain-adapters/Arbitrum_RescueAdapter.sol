/**
 * notice Meant to copy the Arbitrum_Adapter exactly in how it sends L1 --> L2 messages but is designed only to be
 * used by the owner of the HubPool to retrieve ETH held by its aliased address on L2. This ETH builds up because
 * `relayTokens` calls `l1ERC20GatewayRouter.outboundTransfer` which does not allow the caller to specify an L2 refund
 * address the same way that `l1Inbox.createRetryableTicket` does. This means that the alias address of the caller, the
 * HubPool in this case, receives ETH on L2. This Adapter can be used to send messages to Arbitrum specifically to send
 * transactions as if called by the aliased HubPool address.
