About Game
Fantasy Heroes is a new RPG game. In less than a year, Fantasy Heroes became a cult RPG among the fans of 
this genre and even followed in the footsteps of a legendary role-playing game, being one of the best Diablo-like 
titles. The game world is full of spectacular adventures and customizable characters.

Character Selection
There are six playable characters in Fantasy Heroes, and each of them comes which their own unique characteristics 
and combat effects. Unlike other popular action games, Fantasy Heroes allows you to choose not one, but three 
characters to form a raid party. Fantasy Heroes has these classes to offer: 
• Knight – DPS character with strong melee damage. 
• Elf – an archer who is able to support their teammates from a long range. 
• Dwarf – a support hero with skills to fight at a distance. 
• Abyss Catcher – a mage with strong arcane damage. 
• Sorcerer – a mage who can heal friendly heroes. 
• Priest – a mage with a set of auxiliary spells for support. 
During the adventures in Fantasy Heroes, the team of heroes carry out raids on beautiful and well-drawn locations, 
where they fight both ordinary mobs and unique bosses of this action game. 
The heroes will receive experience points and gold for killing monsters, and those rewards can be used to upgrade 
their skills. Action RPG heroes will kill ordinary mobs on their own, you just need to lead them to the right spot, but 
it’s not the same with boss battles, where you have to use various super-blows and power-ups to secure a win. 

Leveling up and Strengthening a team
As in any RPG game, you have two goals: to reach the final boss, while leveling up all of your heroes to the limit. In 
the vastness of the game world, you can find chests with hidden valuables including equipment, weapons, unique 
potions and magic arrows. With the help of found loot you can significantly strengthen each hero, as well as improve 
the synergy of the whole team. If one of your character dies (and this is a possibility), you can always use a respawn 
point to resurrect them. 

Game features and Restrictions
Fantasy Heroes is an action game with RPG elements, which does not require an active internet connection. It features 
unique graphics with colorful locations and dynamic battles in the best traditions of the action genre. The RPG game also 
features high-quality musical score, which makes the gameplay even more exciting and allows you to fully immerse in the 
world of remarkable adventures and action battles. This RPG does not have any built-in restrictions on attempts, limits in 
energy and other obstacles designed to prevent players from leveling up their characters. The RPG features more than 
1000 different items of combat equipment, which allows to create endless unique builds. You can also choose unique power 
buffs and upgrade skills to make the gameplay of this RPG more dynamic, while defeating bosses and fighting for the most 
valuable rewards. You will be pleasantly surprised with the abundance of fantasy elements in Fantasy Heroes, including such 
unique NPC characters for action fights as dragons, golems, gremlins, etc. 

Premium Content 
This action RPG also features paid content, so that players can immediately purchase everything they need for the most dynamic 
action game. Thankfully, it is not necessary to buy starter packs, because every player can easily level up any character just by 
playing this game for a couple days. Right after creating a team and choosing your heroes, you will need to complete few tutorial 
levels in this fantasy game, where you will learn how to manage your army, switch between characters, use super-blows, kill 
monsters and master every aspect of the RPG. Fantasy Heroes is an exciting action game with RPG elements, where you can 
dive in spectacular battles and raids in the amazing world of arcane magic.
