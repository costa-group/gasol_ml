Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy of them for your reference. Please also note that there may be specific terms or conditions applicable to you as a user in a given jurisdiction, as detailed below.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy, available at link, for information about how we collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you.

AGREEMENT TO TERMS
This End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (“EULA” or “Terms”) is a binding contract between you, an individual user or site visitor, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“user,” “you,” “your”) and the Infidia Foundation (the “Foundation,” “we,” “us” or “our”) concerning use of the Foundation’s services (the “Service”), including the www.Infidia.org website as well as any other media form, media channel, or mobile website related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). Currently, the Foundation maintains and operates www.Infidia.org as a portal for news, information, and updates about the Infidia protocol or blockchain (the “Infidia Network”) and the Infidia ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, the Foundation does not control the Infidia Network and cannot control activity and data on the Infidia Network, the activities of persons who develop and use applications on the Network, the validation of transactions on the Infidia Network, or use of the Infidia Network. Infidia The Network is an open-source protocol that is maintained and processed by Infidia Network validators across the globe.

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE OR SITE.
Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to this EULA at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of the EULA, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review the EULA to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised EULA by your continued use of the Service after the date such revised EULA is posted.

The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
The Service is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. You agree that by using the Site and the Service you are at least 18 years of age, or accessing the Service under the supervision of a parent or guardian, and you are legally able to enter into a contract. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in relation to the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of another person or entity, (a) all references to “you” throughout the EULA will include that person or entity, (b) you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person’s or entity’s behalf, and (c) in the event you or the person or entity violates these Terms, the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us.

PLEASE NOTE: THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION OF THIS EULA CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND PROHIBITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE FOUNDATION ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
SCOPE OF LICENSE TO USERS
The Service is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of the EULA, subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the EULA. The Foundation hereby grants you a personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license to access and use the Service solely for your own use.
You may not modify, alter, reproduce, or distribute the Service. You may not directly rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Service. You may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the Service, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law), nor attempt to disable or circumvent any security or other technological measure designed to protect the Service or any content available through the Service. If you breach these license restrictions, or otherwise exceed the scope of the licenses granted in the EULA, then you may be subject to prosecution and damages, as well as liability for infringement of intellectual property rights, and denial of access to the Service.

WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THIS EULA OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SITE AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. If we terminate or suspend your access to the Site for any reason, you are prohibited from attempting to access the Site under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your access, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.
