/**
 * title Drippie
 * notice Drippie is a system for managing automated contract interactions. A specific interaction
 * is called a "drip" and can be executed according to some condition (called a dripcheck) and an
 * execution interval. Drips cannot be executed faster than the execution interval. Drips can
 * trigger arbitrary contract calls where the calling contract is this contract address. Drips can
 * also send ETH value, which makes them ideal for keeping addresses sufficiently funded with ETH.
 * Drippie is designed to be connected with smart contract automation services so that drips can be
 * executed automatically. However, Drippie is specifically designed to be separated from these
 * services so that trust assumptions are better compartmentalized.
